1.1.9 Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the master node.
For example,
chmod 644 <path/to/cni/files>

1.1.10 Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the master node.
For example,
chown root:root <path/to/cni/files>

1.1.12 On the etcd server node, get the etcd data directory, passed as an argument --data-dir,
from the below command:
ps -ef | grep etcd
Run the below command (based on the etcd data directory found above).
For example, chown etcd:etcd /var/lib/etcd

1.1.19 Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the master node.
For example,
chown -R root:root /etc/kubernetes/pki/

SecurityContextDeny, unless PodSecurityPolicy is already in place.
--enable-admission-plugins=...,SecurityContextDeny,...

1.2.15 Follow the documentation and create Pod Security Policy objects as per your environment.
Then, edit the API server pod specification file /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
on the master node and set the --enable-admission-plugins parameter to a
value that includes PodSecurityPolicy:
--enable-admission-plugins=...,PodSecurityPolicy,...
Then restart the API Server.

1.2.25 Edit the API server pod specification file /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
and set the below parameter as appropriate and if needed.
For example,
--request-timeout=300s

4.2.10 If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set tlsCertFile to the location
of the certificate file to use to identify this Kubelet, and tlsPrivateKeyFile
to the location of the corresponding private key file.
If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file
/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service on each worker node and
set the below parameters in KUBELET_CERTIFICATE_ARGS variable.
--tls-cert-file=<path/to/tls-certificate-file>
--tls-private-key-file=<path/to/tls-key-file>
Based on your system, restart the kubelet service. For example:
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service

4.2.13 If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set TLSCipherSuites: to
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
or to a subset of these values.
If using executable arguments, edit the kubelet service file
/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service on each worker node and
set the --tls-cipher-suites parameter as follows, or to a subset of these values.
--tls-cipher-suites=TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
